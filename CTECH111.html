I really enjoyed this class, as it gives us a chance to explore our creative side. There was one particular assignment about infographics, in which we had to show visualization is a creative way. I had a lot of fun with that assignment, and I used adobe illustrator to create human shaped icons, and color them accordingly to depict the age of instagram users.

                                                One of the guest lectures I really enjoyed, where the speaker gave us a lot of information about the current job markets, and what to expect once we graduate from the university and enter the real world. That session was really informative, and helped me prepare a lot before my job search. The Html journal was also fun to make, with all the animations, and boost my creativity. The soap opera group assignment was a great experience, since I worked with a lot of people from other major like films, and got to see their creative work.
