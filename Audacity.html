I have always wondered how people edit these podcasts with music of their choice, and now I found as well as learnt a great tool for it. I have always been into music, and singing, and I am really excited to record my songs and edit them in audacity.

                                               It’s been a while since I visited India, so I decided to recreate some of my memories with different kinds of sounds. My uncle’s house is in a small town, and I have a lot of amazing memories there. Since I grew up in an industrial town, I really enjoyed the quiet moments there. It was a perfect spot for relaxation, since it did not have the hustle of the city. 


                                                <br> <br>

                                                My music track consists of sounds which could be related to that place, like the fresh morning sounds, the trains that passed the town once a while, the sound of rivers, bicycles,ice cream trucks, as well as the winds at night, and cricket chirping. I used most of the sounds from here, like the sound of waters, the sounds of trains, bicycle ( a friend of mine owns one), the sounds of pigeons in the morning( a lot of pigeons come in our balcony and have nests- we never disturb them), and the sounds at night time.
