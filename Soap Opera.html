It was hilarious, while we were doing the assignment, especially the expressions of everyone was priceless. I had to learn some photoshop while doing the assignment, since I was the editor, and had to edit a lot of pictures. We used jam to depict fake blood, and then while some of my group mates were taking pictures, we never noticed the empty jam containers coming in our shots, which was hilarious!

                                                I had also learnt a lot of essential photoshop features, while doing this assignment, some of which include editing objects from the background, and blending the empty space with the background,  adding objects in a picture, but make it real. Some of the tools I used a lot in this assignment were lasso tool, spot healer brush, color picker tool, magic wand tool, etc. 
                                                I got a lot of creative ideas from hanging out with my groupmates, especially the ones with film majors, and saw some of their collection which they used for shots. I am looking forward to implementing some of these ideas in future.
