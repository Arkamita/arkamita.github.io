It also has an endless number of projects in the tinkercad library, and the option to take stuff from there and modify it in our projects. 3d printing is a cool thing, especially because we can build an object by ourselves from scratch, and shape it however we like, just with a few clicks. These softwares are great for building custom made gifts, as it makes them unique.

                                               I made a model of a bedroom in my 3D printing assignment. It is a simple brightly colored bedroom, with red  yellow walls which has a huge closet. It kind of resembles my bedroom back home, especially the wall colors, and the huge closet. My bedroomâ€™s red wall has golden designs in it though. It has a staircase type bed, I have always liked them, they are so much fun to use. There is space on each side to sit. There is also a huge ball, which is meant for working out at home. There is a table lamp, a stool and a small drawer to keep essential things. Also the bed has a lot of pillows, which makes it more comfortable.
