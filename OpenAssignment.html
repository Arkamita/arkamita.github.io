                                                <br> <br>
                                            
                                                This is more of like a resume, but not so formal. The purpose of this website is that, since resumes are very professional, I have a chance to put all my experiences, hobbies and activities here, which might give recruiters some idea about my personality, if they decide to look me up. 

                                                

                                                <br> <br>

                                                I used html, css, bootstrap and javascript animations, from a library called anime.js, which is available in github. I hadn’t used javascript for a while, so this was a good opportunity for me to revise some of that. The website is responsive, and fits both mobile and laptop screens. The front page has some javascript animations, and if you click anywhere on the front page, there are firecrackers which show up!!
                                                It also has social media icons, places to connect to social media platforms. I didn’t connect them to anything since i am not really on social media, however they are placeholders if I decide otherwise later.
